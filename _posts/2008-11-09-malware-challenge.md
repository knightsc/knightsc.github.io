Recently the NeoInfoSec guys put on a malware reverse engineering challenge. You can find out more information <a href="http://www.malwarechallenge.info">here.</a> The winners still haven't been announced because they're still reviewing all the submissions. I have never analyzed malware before but I figured since I'd done a lot of reverse engineering I would give it a shot. Below is the link to the paper that I submitted.
